# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data---Course-Project
run_analysis.R is an R file with code which downloads the samsung smartphone data, merges the training and test data, and keeps only the variables which have 'mean()' or 'std()' in the variable name. It then creates a tidy dataset with the average each of these measures for each subject and activity. This new dataset is written to a text file at the end of the code.  

CodeBook.md explains what each variable/data frame in the R code is, and how it was created by transforming another variable/data frame.
